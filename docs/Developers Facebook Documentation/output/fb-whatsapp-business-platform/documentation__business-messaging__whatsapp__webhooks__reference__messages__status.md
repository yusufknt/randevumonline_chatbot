# Status messages webhook reference

Updated: Apr 30, 2026

This reference describes trigger events and payload contents for WhatsApp Business Account status **messages** webhook.

## Triggers

- Your message is sent to a WhatsApp user.
- Your message is delivered to a WhatsApp user’s device.
- Your message is displayed (i.e. “read”) in the WhatsApp client on a WhatsApp user’s device.
- Your message is unable to be sent to a WhatsApp user.
- Your message is unable to be delivered to a WhatsApp user’s device.
- Your message is sent to a WhatsApp user in a group chat.
- Your voice message is played by the WhatsApp user’s device.

Note that the triggers above also apply to a WhatsApp user who is part of a group chat.

A status is considered read only if it has been delivered. In some cases, like when a user receives a message while in the chat screen, the message is both delivered and read at the same time. In these cases, the “delivered” webhook is not sent because it’s implied that the message was delivered since it was read. This behavior is due to internal optimization.

This example v24.0 webhook describes a marketing message that has been displayed in the WhatsApp client (i.e. “read”). Notice that in this case, the `conversation` object is omitted because it’s a v24.0 webhook, and the `pricing` object is omitted because it happened to be displayed in an associated delivered status messages webhook (the object can only appear in one or the other).

```json
{
  "object": "whatsapp_business_account",
  "entry": [
    {
      "id": "102290129340398",

        {
          "value": {
            "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
            "metadata": {

              "phone_number_id": "106540352242922"
            },
            "statuses": [
