### What happens when I delete a group?

- No members, including you, will be able to message the group.
- If any messages or statuses were received by Cloud API before the group was deleted, you may still receive webhooks for those.

### Why can’t a participant join the group using my invite link?

Some possible reasons include:

- The invite link may have been deleted.
- You may have removed the participant from the group previously.
- The group may already be full.

### How can I send my invite link to users?

- You can send the invite link over a 1:1 conversation.
- A new utility template is available in the [Template Library](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/template-library) to [send group invite links](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/groups/reference#send-group-invite-link-template-message) .
- You may also create custom, free-form marketing templates.
