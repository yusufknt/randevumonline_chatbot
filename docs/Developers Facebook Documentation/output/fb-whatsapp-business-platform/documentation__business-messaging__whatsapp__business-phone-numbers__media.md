## Get media ID

Some of the API requests described in this document require a media ID. Media IDs are returned by the API when [uploading media](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/media#upload-media), and are included in incoming media messages webhooks ([image messages](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/webhooks/reference/messages/image), [video messages](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/webhooks/reference/messages/video), etc.)

Media IDs returned by the API expire after 30 days. Media IDs in webhooks expire after 7 days.

## Upload media

Use the [Media Upload API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-phone-number/media-upload-api) to [upload media](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-phone-number/media-upload-api#post-version-phone-number-id-media). Include the parameters listed below. All media files sent through this API are encrypted and persist for 30 days, unless they are deleted earlier.

| Endpoint | Authentication |
| --- | --- |
| `/PHONE_NUMBER_ID/media`<br>(See [Get Phone Number ID](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/phone-numbers#get-all-phone-numbers)) | Developers can authenticate their API calls with the access token generated in the App Dashboard > WhatsApp > API Setup.<br>Solution Partners must authenticate themselves with an access token with the `whatsapp_business_messaging` permission. |

### Parameters

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `file` | **Required.**<br>Path to the file stored in your local directory. For example: “@/local/path/file.jpg”. |
| `type` | **Required.**<br>Type of media file being uploaded. See [Supported Media Types](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/media#supported-media-types) for more information. |
| `messaging_product` | **Required.**<br>Messaging service used for the request. In this case, use `whatsapp`. |

### Request

```html
curl 'https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<PHONE_NUMBER_ID>/media' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
-F 'messaging_product=whatsapp' \
-F 'file=@<FILE_PATH_AND_NAME>;type=<MIME_TYPE>'
```

### Response

Upon success:

```html
{
  "id": "<MEDIA_ID>"
}
```

### Example request

```curl
curl 'https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/106540352242922/media' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer EAAJB...' \
-F 'messaging_product=whatsapp' \
-F 'file=@/media/template_assets/black_friday_2025.mp4;type=video/mp4'
```

### Example response

```json
{
  "id": "1037543291543636"
}
```

## Get media URL

Use the [Media API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/media/media-api) to [get a media URL](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/media/media-api#get-version-media-id) by querying the [media ID](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/media#get-media-id) directly. You can then use the URL with your access token to [download the media asset](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/media#download-media). Note that incoming media messages webhooks ([image messages](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/webhooks/reference/messages/image), [video messages](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/webhooks/reference/messages/video), and so on) include the media URL, which is assigned to the `url` property.

Media URLs **expire after 5 minutes**, after which you must query the ID again to get a new URL.

### Request syntax

```html
curl 'https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<MEDIA_ID>?phone_number_id=<BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID>' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer EAAJB'
```

Note that `phone_number_id` is optional. If included, the request will only be processed if the business phone number ID included in the query matches the ID of the business phone number that the media was uploaded on.

### Response syntax

A successful response includes an object with a media url. The URL is only valid for 5 minutes. To use this URL, see [Download Media](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/media#download-media).

```html
{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
  "url": "<MEDIA_URL>",
  "mime_type": "<MEDIA_MIME_TYPE>",
  "sha256": "<SHA_256_HASH>",
  "file_size": "<MEDIA_FILE_SIZE>",
  "id": "<MEDIA_ID>"
}
```

## Delete media

Use the [Media API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/media/media-api) to [delete a media asset](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/media/media-api#delete-version-media-id).

### Request syntax

```html
curl -X DELETE 'https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<MEDIA_ID>?phone_number_id=<BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID>' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer EAAJB...'
```

Note that `phone_number_id` is optional. If included, the request will only be processed if the business phone number ID included in the query matches the ID of the business phone number that the media was uploaded on.

### Example response

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

## Download media

Use the [Media Download API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/media/media-download-api) to [download media](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/media/media-download-api#get-media-url). Include your access token in the request. **If you omit your token, the request will fail.**

Note that when retrieving a media from a media ID received via webhook, the media ID will only be available to download for 7 days.

### Request syntax

```html
curl '<MEDIA_URL>' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer EAAJB...' \
-o '<DESIRED_FILE_NAME>'
```

Upon success, the API will respond with the binary data of the media asset. Response headers contain a content-type header to indicate the mime type of returned data. Check [supported media types](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/media#supported-media-types) for supported media types.

If the download attempt fails, you will receive a `404 Not Found` response code. In that case, try to [get a new media URL](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/media#get-media-url) and download it again. If doing so doesn’t resolve the issue, renew your access token and attempt to download the media asset again.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JPEG | .jpeg | image/jpeg | 5 MB |
| PNG | .png | image/png | 5 MB |

### Sticker

WebP images can only be sent in [sticker messages](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/messages/sticker-messages).

| Sticker Type | Extension | MIME Type | Max Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Animated sticker | .webp | image/webp | 500 KB |
| Static sticker | .webp | image/webp | 100 KB |

### Video

Only H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec supported. Single audio stream or no audio stream only.

Note that videos encoded with the H.264 “High” profile and B-frames are not supported by Android WhatsApp clients. We recommend that you use H.264 “Main” profile without B-frames, or the H.264 “Baseline” profile when encoding (or re-encoding with a tool like ffmpeg), and place moov boxes before mdat boxes, for broader compatibility. If you are using ffmpeg, you can use the -movflags faststart flag to place moov boxes before mdata boxes.

| Video Type | Extension | MIME Type | Max Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3GPP | .3gp | video/3gpp | 16 MB |
| MP4 Video | .mp4 | video/mp4 | 16 MB |

Note that mismatched MIME type (`131053`) is a common error. Inspect your media files to verify their MIME type. Make sure that your file name extensions reflect their types. For example, if you are using UNIX, you can inspect a file via the command line to determine its MIME type:

`file -I your-image-asset.png`

## Media message download constraints

The maximum supported file size for media messages on Cloud API is 100MB. In the event the customer sends a file that is greater than 100MB, you will receive a webhook with error code [131052](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/support/error-codes#other-errors) and `title`:

*“Media file size too big. Max file size we currently support: 100MB. Please communicate with your customer to send a media file that is smaller than 100MB”*.

Send customers a warning message that their media file exceeds the maximum file size when this webhook event is triggered.
