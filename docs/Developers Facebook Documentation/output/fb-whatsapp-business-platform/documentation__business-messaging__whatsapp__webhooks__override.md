# Webhook overrides

Updated: Mar 23, 2026

Webhooks are sent to the callback URL set on your app, but you can override this for your own app by designating an alternate callback URL for the WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) or business phone number.

When a webhook is triggered for a [supported field](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/webhooks/override#supported-webhook-fields), the system first checks if your app has designated an alternate callback URL for the business phone number associated with the event. If set, the webhook is sent to your alternate callback URL. If the phone number has no alternate, the system checks if the WABA associated with the number has an alternate callback URL, and if set, sends it there. If the WABA also has no alternate, the webhook falls back to your app’s callback URL.

## Supported webhook fields

The override applies only to the following webhook field types. Webhooks for field types not listed here are always sent to your app’s default callback URL.

- `messages`
- `message_echoes`
- `calls`
- `consumer_profile`
- `messaging_handovers`
- `group_lifecycle_update`
- `group_participants_update`
- `group_settings_update`
- `group_status_update`
- `smb_message_echoes`
- `smb_app_state_sync`
- `history`
- `account_settings_update`

**Note:** Template webhooks (`message_template_status_update`, `message_template_quality_update`, `message_template_components_update`, `template_category_update`) and account-level webhooks (`account_update`, `account_review_update`, `account_alerts`) do not support callback overrides. These webhooks are always delivered to your app’s default callback URL.

## Requirements

Before setting an alternate callback URL, make sure your app is [subscribed to webhooks on the WABA](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/solution-providers/manage-webhooks#subscribe-to-a-whatsapp-business-account) and verify that your alternate callback endpoint can receive and process webhooks correctly.

## Set WABA alternate callback

Use the [Subscribed Apps API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-account/subscribed-apps-api#post-version-waba-id-subscribed-apps) to set an alternate callback URL on a WABA.

### Request syntax

```https
POST /<WABA_ID>/subscribed_apps
```

### Post body

```json
{
  "override_callback_uri":"<WABA_ALT_CALLBACK_URL>",
  "verify_token":"<WABA_ALT_CALLBACK_URL_TOKEN>"
}
```

### Body parameters

| Placeholder | Description | Example Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<WABA_ALT_CALLBACK_URL>` | **Required.**<br>Alternate callback URL where [supported webhooks](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/webhooks/override#supported-webhook-fields) should be sent.<br>Maximum 200 characters. | `https://my-waba-alternate-callback.com/webhook` |
| `<WABA_ALT_CALLBACK_URL_TOKEN>` | **Required.**<br>Alternate callback URL [verification token](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks/getting-started#verification-requests).<br>No maximum. | `myvoiceismypassport?` |

### Response

Upon success:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

### Example request

```curl
curl -X POST \
'https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/102290129340398/subscribed_apps' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer EAAJi...' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '
{
  "override_callback_uri":"https://my-waba-alternate-callback.com/webhook",
  "verify_token":"myvoiceismypassport?"
}'
```

### Example response

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

## Get WABA alternate callback

Use the [Subscribed Apps API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-account/subscribed-apps-api#get-version-waba-id-subscribed-apps) to get a list of all apps subscribed to webhooks on the WABA. The response should include an `override_callback_uri` property and value.

### Example response

```json
{
  "data" : [
    {
      "whatsapp_business_api_data" : {
        "id" : "670843887433847",
        "link" : "https://www.facebook.com/games/?app_id=67084...",
        "name" : "Lucky Shrub"
      },
      "override_callback_uri" : "https://my-waba-alternate-callback.com/webhook"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Delete WABA alternate callback

Use the [Subscribed Apps API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-account/subscribed-apps-api#post-version-waba-id-subscribed-apps) to subscribe your app to webhooks on the WABA [as you normally would](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/solution-providers/manage-webhooks#subscribe) (i.e. without any post body parameters). This will remove the alternate endpoint’s callback URL from the WABA, and webhooks for the WABA will once again be sent to the callback URL set in the App Dashboard.

## Set phone number alternate callback

Use the [WhatsApp Business Phone Number API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-phone-number/whatsapp-business-account-phone-number-api#post-version-phone-number-id) to set an alternate callback URL on the business phone number.

### Request syntax

```https
POST /<BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID>
```

### Post body

```json
{
  "webhook_configuration": {
    "override_callback_uri": "<PHONE_ALT_CALLBACK_URL>",
    "verify_token": "<PHONE_ALT_CALLBACK_URL_TOKEN>"
  }
}
```

### Body parameters

| Placeholder | Description | Example Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<PHONE_ALT_CALLBACK_URL>` | **Required.**<br>Alternate callback URL where [supported webhooks](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/webhooks/override#supported-webhook-fields) should be sent.<br>Maximum 200 characters. | `https://my-phone-alternate-callback.com/webhook` |
| `<PHONE_ALT_CALLBACK_URL_TOKEN>` | **Required.**<br>Alternate callback URL [verification token](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks/getting-started#verification-requests).<br>No maximum. | `myvoiceismypassport?` |

### Response

Upon success:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

### Example request

```curl
curl -X POST 'https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/106540352242922' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer EAAJB...' \
-d '
{
  "webhook_configuration": {
    "override_callback_uri": "https://my-phone-alternate-callback.com/webhook",
    "verify_token": "myvoiceismypassport?"
  }
}'
```

### Example response

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

## Get phone number alternate callback

Use the [WhatsApp Business Phone Number API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-phone-number/whatsapp-business-account-phone-number-api#get-version-phone-number-id) and request the `webhook_configuration` field to verify that the business phone number has an alternate callback URL.

### Request syntax

```https
GET /<BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID>
  ?fields=webhook_configuration
```

### Response

Upon success:

```json
{
  "webhook_configuration": {
    "phone_number": "<PHONE_ALT_CALLBACK_URL>",
    "whatsapp_business_account": "<WABA_ALT_CALLBACK_URL>",
    "application": "<APP_CALLBACK_URL>"
  },
  "id": "106540352242922"
}
```

Note that `whatsapp_business_account` is only included if the WABA associated with the business phone number also has an alternate callback URL set.

### Example request

```curl
curl 'https://graph.facebook.com/v17.0/106540352242922?fields=webhook_configuration' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer EAAJB...'
```

### Example response

```json
{
  "webhook_configuration": {
    "phone_number": "https://my-phone-alternate-callback.com/webhook",
    "whatsapp_business_account": "https://my-waba-alternate-callback.com/webhook",
    "application": "https://my-production-callback.com/webhook"
  },
  "id": "106540352242922"
}
```

## Delete phone number alternate callback

To delete a business phone number’s alternate callback URL, use the [WhatsApp Business Phone Number API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-phone-number/whatsapp-business-account-phone-number-api#post-version-phone-number-id) with the `override_callback_uri` property set to an empty string:

```json
{
  "webhook_configuration": {
    "override_callback_uri": ""
  }
}
```
