# SIP Configuration Guide - WhatsApp Business Calling

Updated: Dec 15, 2025

When SIP is enabled, you **cannot use calling related Graph API endpoints** and **calling related webhooks are not sent**.

## Overview

Session Initiation Protocol ([SIP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3261)) is a signaling protocol used for initiating, maintaining, modifying, and terminating real-time communication sessions between two or more endpoints.

WhatsApp Business Calling API supports use of SIP as the signaling protocol instead of our Graph API endpoints and Webhooks.

### Before you get started

Before you get started with SIP call signaling, confirm the following:

- You meet overall [calling pre-requisites](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling#step-1--prerequisites)
- Your app has messaging permissions for the business phone number you want to enable SIP for. Test this by sending and receiving messages using Graph API messaging endpoints, then use the same app to configure your SIP server on the business phone number for calling.Double confirm this by using [health status API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/support/health-status) with `PHONE_NUMBER_ID`
- Your app mode is “Live”, not “Development”.
- You have a standards compliant third party SIP server that supports [TLS](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sip#security) transport and digest authentication

See [Signaling and media possible configurations](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling#signaling-and-media-possible-configurations) for more info

## Calling flows using SIP

Before you start, make sure you have [enabled and configured SIP on the business phone number](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sip#configure-update-sip-settings-on-business-phone-number). Meta generates a unique SIP user password for each business phone number + app combination. You will need this information and can retrieve it by using the [get Call Settings endpoint.](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sip#get-phone-number-calling-settings--sip-)

### Security

- TLS transport is mandatory for SIP. Meta will present a valid server cert with subject name that covers our SIP domain wa.meta.vc.
Your SIP server should do the same as Meta ensures your cert is valid and subject name covers SIP domain you configured on the business phone number Meta does NOT support mutual TLS (aka mTLS). This means, when Meta takes the role of a TLS client, your TLS server should not request Client certificate. If you still request client cert, Meta will present a client cert but the cert subject name would refer to a random dynamic host which will not pass certificate validation.Meta adds `transport=TLS` to request URI as part of its SIP requests to your SIP server
- For business initiated calls, SIP invite from your SIP server will be challenged using digest auth. See [business-initiated calls](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sip#business-initiated-calls) for more details
- For user initiated calls, it is highly recommended that you challenge SIP INVITE request from Meta, to use digest auth for more security. See [user-initiated calls](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sip#user-initiated-calls) for more details

### How to test if you have a valid TLS certificate

When a WhatsApp user calls a business, a common reason for your SIP server to **not** receive the SIP INVITE from Meta is the certificate validation error. You can use information here to confirm valid setup.

Run the command `openssl s_client -quiet -verify_hostname {hostname} -connect {hostname}:{port}` by properly substituting hostname and port with your values

Example of valid server cert

```
$ openssl s_client -quiet -verify_hostname meta-voip.example.com -connect meta-voip.example.com:5061
Connecting to 64:ff9b::68f8:b0b8
depth=2 C=US, ST=New Jersey, L=Jersey City, O=The USERTRUST Network, CN=USERTrust RSA Certification Authority
verify return:1
depth=1 C=AT, O=ZeroSSL, CN=ZeroSSL RSA Domain Secure Site CA
verify return:1
depth=0 CN=example.com
verify return:1
```

Example of hostname:port not listening on TLS

```
openssl s_client -quiet -verify_hostname lb01.voice.usw2.pure.cloud -connect lb01.voice.usw2.pure.cloud:5060
Connecting to 34.211.206.63
009F0DFB01000000:error:0A000126:SSL routines::unexpected eof while reading:ssl/record/rec_layer_s3.c:693:
```

Example of invalid cert

```
$ openssl s_client -quiet -verify_hostname meta-inb.byoc.mypurecloud.com -connect meta-inb.byoc.mypurecloud.com:5061
Connecting to 64:ff9b::3652:f1c0
depth=0 jurisdictionC=US, jurisdictionST=California, businessCategory=Private Organization, serialNumber=1515861, C=US, ST=Indiana, L=Indianapolis, O=Genesys Cloud Services, Inc., CN=voice.mypurecloud.com
verify error:num=62:hostname mismatch
verify return:1
depth=2 C=US, O=DigiCert Inc, OU=www.digicert.com, CN=DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA
verify return:1
depth=1 C=US, O=DigiCert Inc, OU=www.digicert.com, CN=DigiCert SHA2 Extended Validation Server CA
verify return:1
depth=0 jurisdictionC=US, jurisdictionST=California, businessCategory=Private Organization, serialNumber=1515861, C=US, ST=Indiana, L=Indianapolis, O=Genesys Cloud Services, Inc., CN=voice.mypurecloud.com
verify return:1
```

In this case, you can alter the certificate to match your hostname or [change your configured SIP server hostname](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sip#configure-update-sip-settings-on-business-phone-number) to match your certificate

### Business-initiated calls

Prerequisites

- You have the required call permission approval from the WhatsApp user [Learn how to obtain user calling permissions](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/user-call-permissions)
- [Retrieve Meta generated SIP password](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sip#include-sip-user-password) and configure it on your SIP server, so it can respond to digest authentication challenge from Meta SIP servers

Calling flow

1. Send an initial [SIP INVITE](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sip#business-initiated-calls--with-webrtc-media-) to our servers. Our SIP domain is wa.meta.vc. To initiate a call to WhatsApp user with phone number 11234567890, the SIP request URI should be ‘sip:+11234567890@wa.meta.vc;transport=tls’ This request will fail with an “SIP 407 Proxy Authentication required” message.
2. Send a 2nd [SIP INVITE](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sip#business-initiated-calls--with-webrtc-media-) with proper Authorization header as per [RFC 3261](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3261#section-22) . The Authorization field’s username attribute must match the from header’s user name which is the business phone numberThe password is generated by Meta and you can retrieve it using [get Call Settings endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sip#get-phone-number-calling-settings--sip-)The username portion of the from header must be the fully normalized business phone numberThe domain name of the from header must match the SIP server you configured on the business phone numberThe `SDP Offer` you include supports ICE, DTLS-SRTP and OPUS (essentially WebRTC media)
3. Send the [SIP INVITE](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sip#business-initiated-calls--with-webrtc-media-) to the WhatsApp user number you want to call.

### User-initiated calls

Prerequisites

- If you plan to use SIP Digest Auth, [retrieve Meta generated SIP password](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sip#include-sip-user-password) and configure it on your SIP server, so it can respond to digest authentication challenge from Meta SIP servers

Calling flow

1. The WhatsApp user calls business phone number and is unaware of whether the business is using SIP or Graph API. In other words, the user experience is identical
2. If the business phone number is SIP enabled, Meta will send an [SIP INVITE](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sip#user-initiated-calls--with-webrtc-media-) to the SIP server [configured on the business phone number](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sip#configure-update-sip-settings-on-business-phone-number)
3. You respond with [SIP digest auth challenge](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sip#user-initiated-calls-with-digest-auth--with-sdes-media-) (recommended) or [SIP OK](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sip#user-initiated-calls--with-webrtc-media-) and pass in an SDP answer

If you are not receiving SIP INVITE from Meta, refer to [SIP specific FAQ](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/faq#session-initiation-protocol--sip--faq) to troubleshoot further

[View sample SIP requests](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sip#sample-sip-requests)

[View example SDP structures](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/reference#sdp-overview-and-sample-sdp-structures)

### Custom SIP headers

The following custom SIP headers are common to both business and user initiated calls

| Header name | Metadata | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x-wa-meta-call-duration | Optional; String | Call duration in seconds. This is present on SIP BYE requests from Meta for termination of an established call. |
| x-wa-meta-wacid | Optional; String | WhatsApp call ID. This is present on SIP INVITE request from Meta for a user-initiated call and SIP BYE requests from Meta for termination of an established call. |

The following custom SIP headers are specific to user-initiated calls

| Header name | Metadata | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x-wa-meta-cta-payload | Optional; String | Present when user-initiates a call from call button that has business specified payload. [Learn more](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/call-button-messages-deep-links#send-interactive-message-with-a-whatsapp-call-button) |
| x-wa-meta-deeplink-payload | Optional; String | Present when user-initiates a call from call deeplink that has business specified payload. [Learn more](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/call-button-messages-deep-links#send-payload-data-in-call-deeplink) |

    "sip": {
      "status": "ENABLED",
      "servers": [
        {

```

### Body parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `status`<br>*String* | **Optional**<br>Enable or disable SIP call signaling for the given business phone number.<br>Default is `DISABLED`.<br>When `status` is `ENABLED`, this phone number will exclusively use SIP for call signaling and will not work with Graph APIs. No webhooks are sent.<br>When `status` is set to `DISABLED`, the SIP `servers` values are not reset.<br>If you enable SIP on the same phone number again, the previously configured `servers` values will take effect.<br>You can configure both status and SIP servers in the same request |
| `servers`<br>*String* | **Optional**<br>The SIP server routing configuration.<br>Each phone number can have only one SIP server configured. The servers is an array to be futureproof.<br>Previously we allowed multiple apps each with their own SIP server but this setup will not work because Meta will terminate the call after receiving BYE from any of the SIP servers.<br>In the GET payload, if you see multiple SIP servers, it means you’ve used the POST API with different access tokens that belong to different apps.<br>The associated app is extracted from the access token used to make the API call.<br>To delete a previously configured SIP server, pass an empty array to this field. If you still see some servers remaining after you clear, those servers may belong to different apps, so you need to use the corresponding access tokens to clear them.<br>Note that at-least 1 SIP server of any app must exist when SIP status is ENABLED. To clear servers for all applications being used with a business phone number, the SIP status should be DISABLED.<br>`hostname` — (*String*) **Required**<br>The host name of the SIP server.<br>Requests must use TLS.<br>`port` — (*String*) **Required**<br>The port within your SIP server that will accept requests.<br>Requests must use TLS.<br>Default port is 5061<br>`request_uri_user_params` — (*String*) **Optional**<br>An optional field for passing any parameters you want included in the user portion of the request URI used in our SIP INVITE to your SIP server.<br>Max key/value size is 128 characters.<br>An example use case would be Trunk Groups ([RFC 4904](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4904))<br>sip:+1234567890@sip.example.comtgrp=wacalltrunk-context=byoc.example.com<br>This example has two user parameters for tgrp, and trunk-context.<br>The effective SIP request URI line for this would be `sip:+1234567890;tgrp=wacall;trunk-context=byoc.example.com@sip.example.com` |

### User-initiated calls with digest auth (with SDES media)

Meta SIP server supports digest auth for user initiated calls. Your SIP server should respond with digest auth challenge
and Meta will resend the SIP INVITE with challenge response. The username used for digest auth is the (normalized) business
phone number and the password is generated by Meta and retrievable using the [get Call settings endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sip#include-sip-user-password).

## Configure SDES for SRTP key exchange

The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) key exchange is a cryptographic protocol used to securely exchange encryption keys between two parties over an insecure communication channel.

You can configure SRTP key exchange to one of two options:

- DTLS (default) — Industry-standard encrypted key exchange. Recommended.
- SDES — Plain text key is included in the SDP which is sent over secure signaling protocol like SIP or Graph API. When SDES is used, there is no need for STUN, ICE and DTLS which could help shorten the call setup time.

### Configure/update SRTP key exchange protocol

Request syntax

```https
POST /<PHONE_NUMBER_ID>/settings
```

Endpoint parameters

| Placeholder | Description | Sample Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<PHONE_NUMBER_ID>`<br>*Integer* | **Required**<br>The business phone number for which you are updating Calling API settings.<br>[Learn more about formatting phone numbers in Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/phone-numbers) | `+12784358810` |

Request body

```curl
{
  "calling": {
    "status": "ENABLED",
    "call_icon_visibility": "DEFAULT"
  . . .
    "srtp_key_exchange_protocol": "DTLS (default) | SDES",
  . . .
  }
. . .
}
```

Body parameters

| Parameter | Description | Sample Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `srtp_key_exchange_protocol`<br>*String* | **Optional**<br>Enable or disable use of SRTP key exchange protocol.<br>Possible values are `SDES` and `DTLS`.<br>Default is `DTLS`.<br>Note: Meta still expects the business side to send the maiden SRTP packet for both user and business initiated calls | `“SDES”` |

Success response

```curl
{
  "success": true
}
```

## IP addresses

The IP addresses used for SIP configuration are the same as those listed for the Webhooks in the [Cloud API Webhooks IP Addresses section](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/webhooks/overview#ip-addresses).

This reference is solely to indicate the IP addresses to allow-list for SIP traffic. When SIP is enabled, calling related webhooks are not sent.

## Troubleshooting
