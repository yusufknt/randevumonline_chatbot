# Flows Encryption

Updated: Dec 17, 2025

This guide specifies how to set and get the business public key for the WhatsApp Flows user experience. Businesses will need to generate a 2048-bit RSA key pair and share a business public key to establish an encrypted GraphQL-powered data exchange channel between them and the WhatsApp consumer client.

## Prerequisites

The phone number must be [successfully registered](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/registration#register), and the business must have [generated a 2048-bit RSA Key](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/flows/guides/whatsapp-business-encryption#gen) as described below.

### Generating a 2048-bit RSA Key Pair

Generate a public and private RSA key pair by typing in the following command:

```
openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 2048
```

This generates 2048-bit RSA key pair encrypted with a password you provided and is written to a file.

Next, you need to export the RSA Public Key to a file:

```
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
```

You can then use it, for example, on your web server to encrypt content such that it can only be read with the private key.

Reusing 2048-bit RSA Key Pairs Option

You could also re-use an existing private/public key pair by extracting a public key from existing certificate:

```
openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in private.pem  > public.pem
```

## Set Business Public Key

To set a business public key using Graph API, make a `POST` request to `/PHONE_NUMBER_ID/whatsapp_business_encryption`.
In your call, include the 2048-bit RSA key you generated. If you have multiple phone numbers linked to a WABA, this API must be called to sign the business public key for each phone number.

In [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), when inputting the business public key as a parameter in the **Body**, select **x-www-form-urlencoded.**

| Endpoint | Authentication |
| --- | --- |
| `/PHONE_NUMBER_ID/whatsapp_business_encryption` | Authenticate yourself with a system user access token and you must have the `whatsapp_business_messaging` permission.<br><br>If you are requesting the code on behalf of another business, the access token needs to have Advanced Access to the `whatsapp_business_messaging` permission. |

### Parameters

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `business_public_key`string | **Required.**<br>2048-bit RSA business public key generated. |

### Example

Sample request:

```curl
curl -X POST \
  'https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/PHONE_NUMBER_ID/whatsapp_business_encryption' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data-urlencode 'business_public_key=BUSINESS_PUBLIC_KEY'
```

For example:

```curl
curl -X POST \
  'https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/PHONE_NUMBER_ID/whatsapp_business_encryption' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data-urlencode 'business_public_key=-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
AAA
BBB
CCC
DDD
EEE
FFF
GGG
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----'
```

A successful request returns HTTP status code `200` and the payload:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

## Get Business Public Key

The phone number must be [successfully registered](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/registration#register), and the business must have [generated a 2048-bit RSA key](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/flows/guides/whatsapp-business-encryption#gen).

To get a business public key using Graph API, make a `GET` request to `/PHONE_NUMBER_ID/whatsapp_business_encryption`.

| Endpoint | Authentication |
| --- | --- |
| `/PHONE_NUMBER_ID/whatsapp_business_encryption` | Authenticate yourself with a system user access token and you must have the `whatsapp_business_messaging` permission.<br><br>If you are requesting the code on behalf of another business, the access token needs to have Advanced Access to the `whatsapp_business_messaging` permission. |

### Parameters

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `business_public_key`string | Stored 2048-bit RSA business public key. |
| `business_public_key_signature_status`string | Status of stored 2048-bit RSA business public key. |

### Example

Sample request:

```curl
curl -X GET \
  'https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/PHONE_NUMBER_ID/whatsapp_business_encryption' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN'
```

A successful response looks like this:

```json
{
  "business_public_key": "<2048_bit_RSA_key>"
  "business_public_key_signature_status": VALID | MISMATCH
}
```
