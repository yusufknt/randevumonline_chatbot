# Receiving Flow Response

Updated: Oct 3, 2025

Upon flow completion a response message will be sent to the WhatsApp chat. You will receive it in the same way as you receive all other messages from the user - via message webhook. `response_json` field will contain flow-specific data.

The structure of flow-specific data is controlled by Flow JSON or, in case you are using Endpoint for your flow, by final response payload from endpoint. See [Response Message Webhook](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/flows/guides/receiveflowresponse) reference page for more details.

The Flow response does not include the Flow ID. You can include a custom field in your Flow payload or an identifier in the `flow_token` field to identify the corresponding Flow.
