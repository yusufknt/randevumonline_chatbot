# Webhooks for Pages

Webhooks for [Pages](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages) can send you real-time notifications of changes to your Pages. For example, you can receive real-time updates whenever users post to your feed, comment on a post, or like your posts.

To set up a Page Webhook:

1. [Set up your endpoint and configure the Webhooks product](#set-up-endpoint-and-product).
2. [Install your app](#install-app) using your Facebook page.

## Setting Up Your Endpoint and Webhook Product

Follow our [Getting Started guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks/getting-started) to create your endpoint and configure the Webhooks product. During configuration, make sure to choose the **Page** object and subscribe to one or more of the Pages fields below.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `feed` | Notifies you when an Page's feed has changed; posts, reactions, shares, etc. |
| `messages` | Notifies you when your page has received a message via Messenger. See the [Webhooks for Messenger guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webhook#events) for a list of all available messages webhooks fields |

## Install Your App

Webhook notifications will only be sent if your Page has installed your Webhooks configured-app, and if the Page has not disabled the **App** platform in its [App Settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications). To get your Page to install the app, have your app send a `POST` request to the Page's [subscribed\_apps](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/page/subscribed_apps) edge using the Page's acccess token.

### Requirements

- A Page access token requested from a person who can perform the
  [`CREATE_CONTENT`, `MANAGE`, or
  `MODERATE`
  task](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages/overview#tasks) on the Page being queried
- The
  [`pages_manage_metadata`
  and
  `pages_show_list`
  permissions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages/overview/permissions-features#permission-dependencies)
  are required for the `feed` webhooks
- The [`pages_messaging`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages/overview/permissions-features#permission-dependencies) is also required for the `messages`

For the messages related fields only

- A Page access token requested from a person who can perform the [`MESSAGING` task](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages/overview#tasks) on the Page being queried
- [`pages_messaging`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/pages_messaging)

#### Sample Request

```
curl -i -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/{page-id}/subscribed_apps
  ?subscribed_fields=feed
  &access_token={page-access-token}"
```

#### Sample Response

```
{
  "success": "true"
}
```

To see which app's your Page has installed, send a `GET` request instead:

#### Sample Request

```
curl -i -X GET "https://graph.facebook.com/{page-id}/subscribed_apps
  &access_token={page-access-token}
```

#### Sample Response

```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "category": "Business",
      "link": "https://my-clever-domain-name.com/app",
      "name": "My Sample App",
      "id": "{page-id}"
    }
  ]
}
```

If your Page has not installed any apps, the API will return an empty data set.

#### Graph API Explorer

If you don't want to install your app programmatically, you can easily do it with the [Graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer) instead:

1. Select your app in the **Application** dropdown menu. This will return your app's access token.
2. Click the **Get Token** dropdown and select **Get User Access Token**, then choose the `pages_manage_metadata` permission. This will exchange your app token for a User access token with the `pages_manage_metadata` permission granted.
3. Click **Get Token** again and select your Page. This will exchange your User access token for a Page access token.
4. Change the operation method by clicking the `GET` dropdown menu and selecting `POST`.
5. Replace the default `me?fields=id,name` query with the Page's **id** followed by `/subscribed_apps`, then submit the query.

## Common Uses

### Getting Page Feed Details

Your app can subscribe to a Page's Feed and get notified anytime any Feed-related change occurs. For example, here's a notification sent when a User posted to a Page.

#### Sample Webhook Response

```
[
  {
    "entry": [
      {
        "changes": [
          {
            "field": "feed",
            "value": {
              "from": {
                "id": "{user-id}",
                "name": "Cinderella Hoover"
              },
              "item": "post",
              "post_id": "{page-post-id}",
              "verb": "add",
              "created_time": 1520544814,
              "is_hidden": false,
              "message": "It's Thursday and I want to eat cake."
            }
          }
        ],
        "id": "{page-id}",
        "time": 1520544816
      }
    ],
    "object": "page"
  }
]
```

Use the `post_id` from the notification to [comment on that Page post](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages/publishing#comment_on_post).

#### Sample API Request

```
curl -i -X POST   "https://graph.facebook.com/{page-post-id}/comments
  ?message=I%20want%20chocolate%20cake%20!
  &access_token=page-access-token"
```

#### Sample API Response

```
{
  "id": "{comment-id}"
}
```
