## Webhooks for Leads

Webhooks for Leads can send you real-time notifications of changes to your [Page's Lead ads](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks/reference/page/#leadgen). For example, you can receive real-time updates whenever users click on a lead ad.

First, set up a Page Webhook:

1. [Set up your endpoint and configure the Webhooks product](#set-up-endpoint-and-product).
2. [Install your app](#install-app) using your Facebook page.

## Setting Up Your Endpoint and Webhook Product

Follow our [Getting Started guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks/getting-started) to create your endpoint and configure the Webhooks product. During configuration, make sure to choose the **Page** object and subscribe to the **leadgen** field.

## Install Your App

Webhook notifications will only be sent if your Page has installed your Webhooks configured-app, and if the Page has not disabled the **App** platform in its [App Settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications). To get your Page to install the app, have your app send a `POST` request to the Page's [subscribed\_apps](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/page/subscribed_apps) edge using the Page's acccess token.

### Requirements

- A Page access token requested from a person who can perform the [ADVERTISE task](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages/overview#tasks) on the Page being queried
- The following [permissions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/):
  - `leads_retrieval`
  - `pages_manage_metadata`
  - `pages_show_list`
  - `pages_read_engagement`
  - `ads_management`

#### Sample Request

*Formatted for clarity*

```
curl -i -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/{page-id}/subscribed_apps
  ?subscribed_fields=leadgen
  &access_token={page-access-token}"
```

#### Sample Response

```
{
  "success": "true"
}
```

To see which app's your Page has installed, send a `GET` request instead:

#### Sample Request

*Formatted for clarity*

```
curl -i -X GET "https://graph.facebook.com/{page-id}/subscribed_apps
  ?access_token={page-access-token}
```

#### Sample Response

```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "category": "Business",
      "link": "https://my-clever-domain-name.com/app",
      "name": "My Sample App",
      "id": "{page-id}"
    }
  ]
}
```

If your Page has not installed any apps, the API will return an empty data set.

#### Graph API Explorer

If you don't want to install your app programmatically, you can easily do it with the [Graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer) instead:

1. Select your app in the **Application** dropdown menu. This will return your app's access token.
2. Click the **Get Token** dropdown and select **Get User Access Token**, then choose the `pages_manage_metadata` permission. This will exchange your app token for a User access token with the `pages_manage_metadata` permission granted.
3. Click **Get Token** again and select your Page. This will exchange your User access token for a Page access token.
4. Change the operation method by clicking the `GET` dropdown menu and selecting `POST`.
5. Replace the default `me?fields=id,name` query with the Page's **id** followed by `/subscribed_apps?subscribed_fields=leadgen`, then submit the query.

## Common Uses

### Getting Page LeadGen Details

Your app can subscribe to a Page's Leads and get notified anytime a change occurs. For example, here's a notification sent when a User clicked on a lead ad.

#### Sample Webhook Response

```
{
   "object": "page",
   "entry": [
       {
           "id": 153125381133,
           "time": 1438292065,
           "changes": [
               {
                   "field": "leadgen",
                   "value": {
                       "leadgen_id": 123123123123,
                       "page_id": 123123123,
                       "form_id": 12312312312,
                       "adgroup_id": 12312312312,
                       "ad_id": 12312312312,
                       "created_time": 1440120384
                   }
               },
               {
                   "field": "leadgen",
                   "value": {
                       "leadgen_id": 123123123124,
                       "page_id": 123123123,
                       "form_id": 12312312312,
                       "adgroup_id": 12312312312,
                       "ad_id": 12312312312,
                       "created_time": 1440120384
                   }
               }
           ]
       }
   ]
}
```
