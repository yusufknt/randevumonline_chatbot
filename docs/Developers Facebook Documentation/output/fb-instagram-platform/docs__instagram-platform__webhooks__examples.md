|  |  |
| --- | --- |

In this instance, `instagram`.  `entry.id` string  The Instagram professional account ID of your app user  `entry.time` int  The time Meta sent the notification  `entry` array of objects  An array containing the contents of the notification   ---   `entry` array of objects  An array containing the contents of the notification | ``` [   {     "object":"instagram",     "entry":[       {         "id":"<YOUR_APP_USERS_INSTAGRAM_ACCOUNT_ID>",         "time":<TIME_META_SENT_THIS_NOTIFICATION>,         <NOTIFICATION_PAYLOAD>       }     ]   }  ] ``` |

### Comments payload

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| The comment event notification payloads include the following:   - `field` set to `comments` or `live_comments` - `value` set to an array that contains:   - The comment ID   - The Instagram-scoped user ID of the Instagram user who commented on your app user's media   - The username of the Instagram user who commented on your app user's media   - Any text that was included in the comment   - The media's ID   - Where the media was located, in an ad, feed, story, or reel | ``` [   {     "object": "instagram",     "entry": [       {         "id": "<YOUR_APP_USERS_INSTAGRAM_ACCOUNT_ID>",         "time": <TIME_META_SENT_THIS_NOTIFICATION>      // Comment or live comment payload         "field": "comments",         "value": {           "id": "<COMMENT_ID>",           "from": {             "id": "<INSTAGRAM_SCOPED_USER_ID>",             "username": "<USERNAME>"           },           "text": "<COMMENT_TEXT>",           "media": {             "id": "<MEDIA_ID>",             "media_product_type": "<MEDIA_PRODUCT_TYPE>"           }         }       }     ]   } ] ``` |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Messaging payload All messaging webhook notifications included the following:   - `object` set to `instagram` - `entry` set to an array containing:   - The Instagram professional account ID of your app user who is in the conversation   - The time Meta sent the notification   - The sender's ID   - The recipient's ID   - The time when the message was sent   - The notification payload for the specific webhook that was triggered | ``` [   {     "object":"instagram",     "entry":[       {         "id": "<YOUR_APP_USERS_INSTAGRAM_ACCOUNT_ID>",         "time": <TIME_META_SENT_NOTIFICATION>,         "messaging": [           {             "sender": { "id": "<SENDER_ID>" },             "recipient": { "id": "<RECIPIENT_ID>" },             "timestamp": <TIME_WEBHOOK_WAS_TRIGGERED>             <NOTIFICATION_PAYLOAD>           }         ]       }     ]   } ] ``` |

Identifying the values for the multiple `id`s within a notification can be confusing since the recipient and sender can vary depending on the action that triggered the webhook. The following table shows the action that triggered the webhook and the ID set for each `id` parameter.

| Action that triggers a messaging webhook | `id` | `recipient.id` | `sender.id` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Your app user **receives** a message from an Instagram user | Your app user's Instagram professional account ID | Your app user's Instagram professional account ID | The Instagram user's Instagram-scoped ID |
| Your app user **sends** a message to an Instagram user | Your app user's Instagram professional account ID | The Instagram user's Instagram-scoped ID | Your app user's Instagram professional account ID |
