# Welcome Message Flows

When creating ads that Click to Instagram Direct, you can connect a message flow from a messaging partner app. A message flow can include text, images, emoji, buttons, and other message types supported by the [Send API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-instagram-login/messaging-api).

This guide shows how to create and manage welcome message flows via the Instagram Platform.

## Requirements

This guide assumes you have read the [Instagram Platform Overview](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/overview) and implemented the needed components for using this API, such as a Meta login flow and a webhooks server to receive notifications.

You will need the following:

#### Access Level

- Advanced Access if your app serves Instagram professional accounts you don't own or manage
- Standard Access if your app serves Instagram professional accounts you own or manage and have added to your app in the App Dashboard

#### Access tokens

- An Instagram User access token requested from a person who can manage messages on the Instagram professional account

#### Base URL

All endpoints can be accessed via the `graph.instagram.com` host.

#### Endpoints

- [`/welcome_message_flows`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference)
- `/<APP_USERS_INSTAGRAM_PRO_ID>` or `/me`

#### IDs

- The ID for the Instagram professional account that is creating the welcome message flow

#### Permissions

- `instagram_business_basic`
- `instagram_business_manage_messages`

### Limitations

- Welcome message flows are only available through Instagram Boost Ads if the Instagram professional account is not linked to a Facebook Page.
- Welcome message flows will not appear in Meta's Ads Manager if the Instagram professional account is not linked to a Facebook Page.

Linking a Facebook Page to the Instagram professional account allows for the welcome message flows to be visible in Ads Manager and accessible for other ad types.

    - `content_type` set to `text`
    - `title` set to the quick reply button text
    - `payload` set to the content to be sent in a webhook notification when a person clicks that button

#### Sample request

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"
     -d '{
           "eligible_platforms":["instagram"],
           "name"="<WELCOME_MESSAGE_FLOW_NAME>",
           "welcome_message_flow": [

                     "content_type":"text",
                     "title":"<QUICK_REPLY_TEXT_1>",
                     "payload":"<QUICK_REPLY_TEXT_1_WEBHOOK_CONTENT>"
                   },
                   {
                     "content_type":"text",
                     "title":"<QUICK_REPLY_TEXT_2>",
                     "payload":"<QUICK_REPLY_TEXT_2_WEBHOOK_CONTENT>"
                   },
                   {

           ]
        }' "https://graph.instagram.com/v25.0/me/welcome_message_flows?access_token=<INSTAGRAM_USER_ACCESS-TOKEN>"
