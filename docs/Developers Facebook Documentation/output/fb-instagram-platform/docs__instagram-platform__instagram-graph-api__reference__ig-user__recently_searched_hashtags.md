# Recently Searched Hashtags

This edge allows you to determine the [IG Hashtags](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-hashtag) that an [IG User](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-user) has queried for within the last 7 days.

## Reading

`GET /{ig-user-id}/recently_searched_hashtags`

Get the hashtags that an [IG User](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-user) has queried using the [IG Hashtags](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-hashtag) endpoint within the last 7 days.

IG Users can query a maximum of 30 unique hashtags within a rolling, 7 day period. A queried hashtag will count against that user's limit as soon as it is queried. Subsequent queries on that hashtag within 7 days of the initial query will not count against the user's limit.

**Limitations**

- Emojis in hashtag queries are not supported.
- The API returns 25 results per page by default, but you can use the `limit` parameter to get up to 30 per page (`limit=30`).
