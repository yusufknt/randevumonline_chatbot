# IG User Media

Represents a collection of [IG Media](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-media) objects on an [IG User](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-user).

On July 9, 2025, we added support for the existing `user_tags` field for image and video stories on the `/<IG_ID>/media` endpoint. You can mention users in a story and optionally specify x, y coordinates to tag them at a particular coordinate in the media.

On March 24, 2025, we introduced the new `alt_text` field for image posts on the `/<INSTAGRAM_PROFESSIONAL_ACCOUNT_ID>/media` endpoint. Reels and stories are not supported.

## Creating

**`POST /<YOUR_APP_USERS_INSTAGRAM_USER_ID>/media`**

- Create an image, carousel, story or reel [IG Container](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-container) for use in the post publishing process. See the [Content Publishing](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/guides/content-publishing) guide for complete publishing steps.

Steps to publish a media object include the following:

1. Create a container
2. Upload the media to the container
3. Publish the container

### Limitations

#### General Limitations

- Containers expire after 24 hours
- An Instagram account can only create 400 containers within a rolling 24 hour period
- If the [Page](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/overview#pages) connected to the targeted Instagram professional account requires [Page Publishing Authorization](https://www.facebook.com/help/www/1939753742723975) (PPA), PPA must be completed or the request will fail
- If the Page connected to the targeted Instagram professional account requires two-factor authentication, the Facebook User must also have performed two-factor authentication or the request will fail
- We strongly recommended the HTTP IETF standard character set for URLs, URLs that contain only US ASCII characters, or the request will fail

#### Reels Limitations

- Reels cannot appear in carousels
- Account privacy settings are respected upon publish. For example, if **Allow remixing** is enabled, published reels will have remixing enabled upon publish but remixing can be disabled on published reels manually through the Instagram app.
- Music tagging is only available for original audio.

#### Story Limitations

- Stories expire after 24 hours.
- Support either video URL or Reels URL but not both.
- Publishing stickers (i.e., link, poll, location) is not supported; however mentioning users without a sticker is supported.

}
```

On success, an Instagram container ID and a URI is returned in the response, which will be used in subsequent steps.

#### Upload a video through resumable upload protocol

Once the Instagram container ID returns from a resumable upload session call, send a `POST` request to the `https://rupload.facebook.com/ig-api-upload/`

`v25.0`

`/<IG_CONTAINER_ID>` endpoint.

- All media\_type shares the same flow to upload the video.
- `ig-container-id` is the ID from the resumable reels, carousel and video container upload session examples above.
- `access-token` is the same one used in other steps.
- `offset` is set to the first byte being upload, generally `0`.
- `file_size` is set to the size of your file in bytes.
- `Your_file_local_path` sets to the file path of your local file, for example, if uploading a file from the **Downloads** folder on macOS, the path is **@Downloads/example.mov**.

```
curl -X POST "https://rupload.facebook.com/ig-api-upload/v25.0/<IG_CONTAINER_ID>" \
     -H "Authorization: OAuth <USER_ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
     -H "offset: 0" \
     -H "file_size: Your_file_size_in_bytes" \
     --data-binary "@Your_local_file_path.extension"
```

On success, you should see response like this example:

```
{
  "success":true,
  "message":"Upload successful. ..."
}
```

#### Upload a video from a hosted URL

This service can also support video upload from a hosted URL.

```
curl -X POST "https://rupload.facebook.com/ig-api-upload/v25.0/<IG_CONTAINER_ID>" \
     -H "Authorization: OAuth <USER_ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
     -H "file_url: <VIDEO_URL>"
```

| `cover_url` | `<COVER_URL>` | For Reels only. The path to an image to use as the cover image for the Reels tab. We will cURL the image using the URL that you specify so the image must be on a public server. If you specify both `cover_url` and `thumb_offset`, we use `cover_url` and ignore `thumb_offset`. The image must conform to the [specifications for a Reels cover photo](#reels-specs). |

Use the [Pages Search API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages/searching) to search for [Pages](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/page) whose names match a search string, then parse the results to identify any Pages that have been created for a physical location. Include the `location` field in your query and verify that the Page you want to use has location data.

See [reel specifications](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-user/media#reel-specifications) for eligibility critera. |
| `thumb_offset` | `<THUMB_OFFSET>` | For videos and reels. Location, in milliseconds, of the video or reel frame to be used as the cover thumbnail image. The default value is `0`, which is the first frame of the video or reel. For reels, if you specify both `cover_url` and `thumb_offset`, we use `cover_url` and ignore `thumb_offset`. |

| `video_url` | `<VIDEO_URL>` | **Required for videos and reels. Applies only to videos and reels.** Path to the video. We cURL the video using the passed-in URL, so it must be on a public server. |
| `trial_params` | `<TRIAL_PARAM>` | An optional parameter for publishing trial reels. The `media_type` must be `REELS` if this parameter is included in the request. Each object should have the following information:   - `graduation_strategy` - **Required**. The graduation strategy specifies the conditions to graduate a reel (convert the trial reel to a reel, sharing it to followers). The value should be either `MANUAL` or `SS_PERFORMANCE`. When `MANUAL`, the trial reel can be manually graduated in the native app. When `SS_PERFORMANCE`, the trial reel will be automatically graduated if the trial reel performs well. |

### Response

A JSON-formatted object containing an [IG Container](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-container) ID which you can use to [publish](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-user/media_publish) the container.

Video uploads are asynchronous, so receiving a container ID does not guarantee that the upload was successful. To verify that a video has been uploaded, request the [`status_code`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-container#fields) field on the IG Container. If its value is `FINISHED`, the video was uploaded successfully.

```
{
  "id":"<IG_CONTAINER_ID>"
}
```
