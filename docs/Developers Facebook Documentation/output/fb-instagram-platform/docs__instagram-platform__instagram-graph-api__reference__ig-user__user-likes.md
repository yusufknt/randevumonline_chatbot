# User Likes

You can like and unlike Instagram Media (Feed, Reels, Carousel) and Comments (Comments, Replies) on behalf of an Instagram User.

## Like a Media or Comment

Publish a "Like" on an Instagram Media or Comment on behalf of an Instagram User.

**Note:** If the object was already liked by the Instagram User, the API has no effect.

**`POST /<IG_USER_ID>/likes`**

### Limitations

- Supports Feed Image, Reels and Carousel objects and their Comments/Replies.
- Stories is not supported.
- Burst rate limit: more than 50 requests in 5 seconds results in a 1-hour lockout for the Instagram User.
- Media and Comments from Private Accounts cannot be liked.
