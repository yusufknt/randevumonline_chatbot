# ig.me Links

`ig.me` is a shortened URL service operated by Meta that redirects users to a conversation in Instagram. You can use them on your website, email newsletters and more.

The format of the URL is **`https://ig.me/<USERNAME>`** where `<USERNAME>` is the Instagram handle of the Instagram professional account.

When a person clicks an `ig.me` URL to start or continue a conversation with an Instagram professional account, the person is redirected to a new or existing thread, based on whether the person had previously messaged the Instagram professional account. A `messages` webhook event is triggered and your webhook server receives a notification. If you add the referral parameter to your URL, the `messaging_postback` webhook event is triggered and the value of the parameter is sent in the notification. You can include the referral parameter in your `ig.me` link to:

- Track different links in different channels
- Tie an Instagram professional user to a session or account in an external app
- Direct the user to specific content or features available within an Instagram professional account

To get the most out of your `ig.me` URLs, you should implement Icebreakers in your Instagram experience for new conversations and set each icebreaker to its own referral parameter.

#### Additional scenarios

Other common scenarios for using an `ig.me` link include the following:

- An `ig.me` link with a QR code on product packaging to allow people to reach out to you for support or get a coupon towards the next purchase.
- An `ig.me` link with a QR code on out of home advertising such as billboards, TV ads, physical stores, etc., to sign up for loyalty or membership accounts.
- An `ig.me` link on the Contact Us page on a website to allow people to contact you via messaging instead of relying on calling.
- Provide people an option to message you on Instagram by sending an `ig.me` link via SMS.

### Limitations

`ig.me` links are currently not supported on Instagram Web.

## User Experience

When a person follows an `ig.me` link, the following content is automatically displayed.

| New conversation You opened this conversation from a link. `<INSTAGRAM_PROFESSIONAL_ACCOUNT_USERNAME>` will see that you used their link once you send a message. | Existing conversation You opened this conversation from a link. `<INSTAGRAM_PROFESSIONAL_ACCOUNT_USERNAME>` can see that you used their link. If you wish to stop receiving messages from them, you can turn off messages. |

### Referral Parameters

You can include the `ref` parameter in your `ig.me` link to:

- Track different links in different channels

### URL format

```
https://ig.me/<USERNAME>?ref=<REFERRAL_PARAMETER_CONTENT>
```

## Webhook notifications

Your webhook server will either receive a `postback` or `message` object with a `referral` object with . The `referral` object will include the following:

- `ref` set to the `<REFERRAL_PARAMETER_CONTENT>` content in the `ig.me`
- `source` set to `SHORTLINKS`
- `type` set to `OPEN_THREAD`

### Examples

When an ig.me link with a `ref` parameter opens the Instagram app, one of the possible use cases can be triggered.

#### New conversation with an Icebreaker

If you have configured Icebreakers for your Instagram Account and the user taps on an Icebreaker, your app receives the a notification with a `postback` object with the following:

- `mid` set to the message ID
- `title` set to the icebreaker question or prompt the person selected
- `payload` set to the information you set to be included when a person selects that particular icebreaker option
- `ref` object

```
{
  "object": "instagram",
  "entry": [
    {
      "id": "<IG_ID>",
      "time": 1502905976963,
      "messaging": [
        {
          "sender": {
            "id": "<IGSID>"
          },
          "recipient": {
            "id": "<IG_ID>"
          },
          "timestamp": 1502905976377,
          "postback": {
            "mid":"<MESSAGE_ID>",
            "title": "<SELECTED_ICEBREAKER_OPTION>",
            "payload": "<ICEBREAKER_OPTION_SELECTED_INFORMATION>,
            "referral": {
                   "ref": "<REFERRAL_PARAMETER_CONTENT>"
                   "source": "SHORTLINKS"
                   "type":  "OPEN_THREAD"
             }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### New Thread with a message

If a person sends a message instead of selecting an icebreaker, your app receives a notification with a `message` object with the following:

- `mid` set to the message ID
- `title` set to the icebreaker question or prompt the person selected
- `payload` set to the information you set to be included when a person selects that particular icebreaker option
- `ref` object

```
...
          "message": {
              "mid":"<MESSAGE_ID>",
              "referral": {
                   "ref": "<REFERRAL_PARAMETER_CONTENT>"
                   "source": "SHORTLINKS"
                   "type":  "OPEN_THREAD"
              }
           }
...
```

#### Existing conversation

If a conversation already exists between the person and the Instagram professional account, and the person clicks the `ig.me` link, the existing conversation is opened and your app receives a notifications with only the `referral` object. Your app has 24 hours to send a reply.

This action resets the 24-hour window for standard messaging, allowing the app to reply after getting the webhook event with the `ref` parameter.

The `messaging_referral` webhook event follows this format:

```
...
          "referral": {
                 "ref": "<REFERRAL_PARAMETER_CONTENT>"
                 "source": "SHORTLINKS"
                 "type":  "OPEN_THREAD"
          }
...
```
