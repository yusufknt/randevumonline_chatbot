### Platform Status

Meta provides a health status page for each of the following:

- Business tools – Ads Manager, Catalog, Shops, and more
- Developer platform – Facebook Login, ads APIs, business messaging APIs, and more
- Transparency tools – Ads and Data transparency tools

Each status page allows you to view the current health of a product, tool, or API.

- A checkmark within a green circle – The service is operational with no known issues
- An exclamation within a yellow triangle – The service is recovering from disruptions or is experiencing partial disruptions
- A dash within a red stop sign – The service is currently down or experiencing major disruptions

Click the chevron to the right of an API or product to view more information.

#### View History

Click the **View History** button at the bottom of the page to see any issues that have occurred in the last 90 days. This allows you to see when an issue occurred, its duration, and status.

#### RSS Feed

Click the **RSS Feed** button at the bottom of the page to sign up for real-time status notifications for each platform or tool you care about.

### Business messaging status

Get additional information for business messaging APIs, including current and historical data for availability and latency.

#### Availability

The availability of an API or tool is shown as a percentage and is calculated by subtracting the downtime, in minutes, from the measured time period, in minutes, divided by the measured time period, in minutes then multiplied by 100.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Percent availability | = | ( Total minutes - Number of minutes the issue occurred ) / Total minutes | X | 100 |



For example, if the time period is 30 days (43200 minutes) and an issue occurred for 23 hours (1380 minutes) during those 30 days, the API was available for 96.81% of the time during those 30 days.

96.81% = ( 43200 - 1380 ) / 43200 X 100



#### Latency

Latency is calculated for inbound and outbound messages.

- **Inbound** – Time from when a message is received from a user to when Meta makes the first attempt to send a corresponding message webhook to the business’s callback URL
- **Outbound** – Time from when Meta receives a send message request from a business to when the message is ready to be transmitted to the user

##### Latency Percentiles

The status page displays P90 and P99 latency percentiles:

- **P90** – 90% of requests are faster than this value
- **P99** – 99% of requests are faster than this value; only 1% are slower
