## Limitations

- [Webhooks](#webhooks) will not be sent if the Media upon which the comment or @mention appears was created by an account that is set to [private](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/448523408565555).

## Endpoints

The API consists of the following endpoints:

- [`GET /{ig-user-id}/tags`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-user/tags) — to get the media objects in which a Business or Creator Account has been tagged
- [`GET /{ig-user-id}?fields=mentioned_comment`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-user/mentioned_comment#reading) — to get data about a comment that an Business or Creator Account has been @mentioned in
- [`GET /{ig-user-id}?fields=mentioned_media`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-user/mentioned_media#reading) — to get data about a media object on which a Business or Creator Account has been @mentioned in a caption
- [`POST /{ig-user-id}/mentions`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-user/mentions#creating) — to reply to a comment or media object caption that a Business or Creator Account has been @mentioned in by another Instagram user

Refer to each endpoint reference document for usage instructions.

## Webhooks

Subscribe to the `mentions` field to recieve [Instagram Webhooks](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/guides/webhooks) notifications whenever an Instagram user mentions an Instagram Business or Creator Account. Note that we do not store Webhooks notification data, so if you set up a Webhook that listens for mentions, you should store any received data if you plan on using it later.

## Examples

### Listening for and Replying to Comment @Mentions

You can listen for comment @mentions and reply to any that meet your criteria:

1. Set up an [Instagram webhook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/guides/webhooks) that's subscribed to the `mentions` field.
2. Set up a script that can parse the Webhooks notifications and identify comment IDs.
3. Use the IDs to query the `GET /{ig-user-id}/mentioned_comment` endpoint to get more information about each comment.
4. Analyze the returned results to identify any comments that meet your criteria.
5. Use the `POST /{ig-user-id}/mentions` endpoint to [reply to those comments](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-user/mentions#creating).

The reply will appear as a sub-thread comment on the comment in which the Business or Creator Account was mentioned.
