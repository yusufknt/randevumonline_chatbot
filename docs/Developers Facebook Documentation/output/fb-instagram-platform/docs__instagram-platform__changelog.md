### New Media Engagement Fields

*Applies to all versions.*

Three new fields are now available on the [IG Media](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/reference/instagram-media) endpoint for apps using Facebook Login, giving deeper insight into how content is being distributed:

- `reposts_count` — Number of times the media has been reposted by other users
- `saved_count` — Number of times the media has been saved
- `shares_count` — Number of times the media has been shared

**Endpoint**

### Aggregated Metrics

*Applies to all versions.*

Introducing three new aggregated metrics that provide comprehensive engagement totals across all surfaces, including boosted media and Facebook crossposted content. These values match what users see in the Instagram Insights Dashboard and are available through both the [IG Media](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/reference/instagram-media) and [Insights](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/insights) endpoints:

- `total_like_count` / `total_likes` — Aggregated likes across Instagram, Facebook, and promoted media
- `total_comments_count` / `total_comments` — Aggregated comments across all surfaces
- `total_views_count` / `total_views` — Aggregated views across all surfaces (video media only)

**Endpoints**

- `GET /{ig_media_id}?fields=total_like_count,total_comments_count,total_views_count`
- `GET /{ig_media_id}/insights?metric=total_likes,total_comments,total_views`

### Enhanced Views Metrics

*Applies to all versions.*

- **`facebook_views` expansion:** The [`facebook_views`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/reference/instagram-media/insights) metric now supports Feed post, Reels, and Story media types, and coverage has expanded to include both crossposted plays and cross-app recommended plays.
- **Cross-platform `view_count`:** The `view_count` field now returns combined Instagram and Facebook views for crossposted video content when looking up another user's public media via the Business Discovery API.

**Endpoints**

- `GET /{ig_media_id}/insights?metric=facebook_views`
- `GET /{ig_user_id}?fields=business_discovery.username({username}).media{view_count}`

### Collaborative Media API

*Applies to all versions.*

Introducing the [**Collaborative Media API**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-facebook-login/collaboration) on the [IG User](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-graph-api/reference/ig-user). The API lets your app retrieve all media where your app user is an accepted collaborator, making it easier to track and measure performance of collaborative content across partnerships.

**Endpoints**

- `GET /<IG_USER_ID>/collaborative_media` — Fetch all collaborative media for the app user
- `GET /<IG_USER_ID>?fields=collaborative_media_search.media_id(<IG_MEDIA_ID>)` — Search for a specific collaborative media

### Partnership Ads Label

*Applies to all versions.*

The [Content Publishing API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/content-publishing#partnership-ads-label) now supports adding the "Paid partnership" disclosure label at publish time, eliminating the need to manually add partnership labels after publishing. Two new parameters have been added to the [create media](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-graph-api/reference/ig-user/media#query-string-parameters) endpoint:

- `branded_content_sponsor_ids` — Tag up to 2 brand partners by their Instagram user ID
- `is_paid_partnership` — Enable the "Paid partnership" label with or without naming specific brands

**Endpoint**

- `POST /<IG_USER_ID>/media` with `branded_content_sponsor_ids` and `is_paid_partnership` parameters

### Like Media and Comments API

*Applies to all versions.*

Introducing the [**Like Media and Comments API**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-graph-api/reference/ig-user/user-likes) on the [IG User](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-graph-api/reference/ig-user). The API lets your app like and unlike Instagram media and comments on behalf of your app users, enabling engagement workflows such as responding to comments on business posts or engaging with collaborative content.

**Endpoints**

- `POST /<IG_USER_ID>/likes` with `media_id={media_id}` or `comment_id={comment_id}` — Like a Feed post, Reel, comment, or reply

- **Past partnership ads media:** You can now query a creator's historical partnership ads media that the creator owns.
- **New filters:** Three new filtering options — follower growth (top growth in last 30 days), latest activity (recently posted creators), and device type (iOS/Android audience filtering).

See [Creator Marketplace API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-facebook-login/creator-marketplace) documentation for more information.

### Partnership Ads

*Applies to all versions.*

- **Username filtering on ad permissions:** The `/{business-account-id}/branded_content_ad_permissions` endpoint now supports filtering by `creator_username`, allowing you to search and retrieve ad permissions for a specific creator. See [Account-Level Permissioning](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/ad-creative/partnership-ads/account-level-permissioning) for more information.
- **Ad code generation:** Creators can now generate partnership ad codes through the API, enabling automated workflows for branded content authorization. See [Ad Codes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/ad-creative/partnership-ads/ad-codes) for more information.

## March 13, 2026

The Instagram Direct Send API now supports sending the images with attachment IDs (in addition to image URLs) which resolves the problem of timeouts when uploading multiple large high-quality images from slow servers. You can use the attachment API to upload the images one at a time and reuse the attachment IDs to send the same image to multiple users. See the [updated dev docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-instagram-login/messaging-api/).

## February 6, 2026

Added support for the `enable_fb_login` parameter in Instagram OAuth authorization requests. This allows developers to control whether the Facebook Login option is shown on the Instagram login page prior to authorization. The default value is `true`. See [Business Login for Instagram](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-instagram-login/business-login) for more information.

## December 19, 2025

### Instagram PDF Attachment

You can now upload and send PDF file attachment in Instagram Direct using [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/instagram/features/send-message/) for Instagram accounts linked with a Facebook page OR the [Instagram API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-instagram-login/messaging-api/) for Intagram-only accounts.

## December 12, 2025

The Instagram Messaging webhook now includes link sticker URLs when users reply to stories via direct message. A new `link_sticker_url` field has been added to the `reply_to.story` object in webhook payloads.

This new field can be used to trigger different messaging automations based on Link Sticker URL in the story.

## December 3, 2025

### Accept/Decline Collaboration Invites

*Applies to all versions.*

Introducing [**Accept/Decline Collaboration Invites**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-facebook-login/collaboration) in [Instagram API with Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-facebook-login) on the [IG User](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-graph-api/reference/ig-user). The API provides the following capabilites:

- Query all the IG Media(s) where the app user's Instagram user has been invited for collaboration
- Accept/Decline a collaboration invite using `media_id` of the tagged IG Media

**Endpoints**

- `GET /<IG_USER_ID>/collaboration_invites`
- `POST /<IG_USER_ID>/collaboration_invites`

`instagram_basic` permission is required to access these endpoints.

### Insights Metrics

*Applies to all versions.*

Introducing the following metrics fields for media insights:

- `reels_skip_rate`
- `reposts`

Introducing the following metrics fields for user insights:

- `reposts`

Additional views metric for Reels crossposted to Facebook:

- `crossposted_views`
- `facebook_views`

Currently, the IG Insights API only returns metrics native to Instagram. However, certain media type like Reels can be crossposted to Facebook, and the aggregation of the views on both platforms shows up on the native Instagram app. Now, `crossposted_views` returns the total number of views for reels that are crossposted to Facebook across both platforms. `facebook_views` returns the total number of views specifically from Facebook.

This change does not affect the Business Discovery API. For media accessed via this API, `view_count` will continue to reflect only Instagram views and will not include aggregated crossposted views.

### Supporting Trial Reels in the Content Publishing API

*Applies to all versions.*

Introducing **Trial Reels Support** in [Instagram API with Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-facebook-login) and [Instagram API with Instagram Login](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-instagram-login) for the [Content Publishing API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/content-publishing).

`trial_params` is optional and part of the [create media](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-graph-api/reference/ig-user/media#creating) endpoint. Users will be able to specify a Trial Reel configuration to create and publish Trial Reels directly from the Instagram API.

### Delete Instagram Media

*Applies to all versions.*

```
DELETE /{ig_media_id}
```

The new API lets your app delete Instagram posts, carousels, reels and stories from your app user’s Instagram account with a new required permission `instagram_manage_contents`.

Read more about the Instagram Media Delete API [**here**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/reference/instagram-media).

November 3, 2025: Multi-image sending is a Beta feature that will be rolled out incrementally over a few weeks . While the feature is rolled out, some Instagram accounts may get an error response [`2534068`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-instagram-login/messaging-api/#send-images) to indicate that the feature is not yet available for that account.

## June 14, 2025

### Business Login for Instagram

*Applies to all versions.*

Introducing the `force_reauth` parameter for Business Login for Instagram. When included in the login flow, this parameter fixes the broken login experience by forcing the app user to reauthenticate even if the user is already logged into Instagram.

#### Live Videos

*Applies to all versions.*

You can now use the Instagram API to get live video IG Media being broadcast by your app users, get comments on those videos, and use the Instagram Messaging API to send private replies (direct messages) to the comment authors. To support this functionality, the following changes have been made:

- a new [GET /ig-user/live\_media](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-user/live_media#reading) edge can return live video [IG Media](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-media/) being broadcast by your app user at the time of the request
- the `media` field on an [IG Comment](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-comment/) now returns and object containing both the ID (`id`) and published location (`media_product_type`) of the media upon which the comment was made
- a new [`live_comments`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks/reference/instagram/#live_comments) Instagram Webhooks field can send notifications containing live comments made on your app users' live videos as they are being broadcast

Please refer to the [Instagram Messaging API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/instagram) private replies documentation to learn how to send [private replies](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/instagram/features/private-replies) to users who have commented on your app users' live video IG Media.

## October 20, 2021

#### IG Comments

*Applies to all versions.*

Two new [fields](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-comment#fields) have been added to [IG Comments](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-comment):

- `from` — returns an object containing the [IGSID](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/instagram/overview#igsid) (`id`) and username (`username`) of the comment creator.
- `parent_id` — returns the ID of the parent IG Comment if this comment was created on another IG Comment (i.e. a reply to another comment).

#### Instagram Webhooks

*Applies to all versions.*

The `comments` Instagram webhooks [field](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks/reference/instagram/#comments) now includes the following properties in the `value` field object:

## October 5, 2021

The following changes apply to Instagram TV videos created on or after October 5, 2021. Instagram TV videos created before this date are exempt from these changes.

- the `media_product_type` [field](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-media/#fields) will return `FEED` instead of `IGTV`
- the `video_title` [field](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-media/#fields) will not be returned

On January 3, 2022, the changes above will apply to all API versions and all Instagram TV videos, regardless of video creation date. This means that starting January 3, 2022, apps using older API versions will be able to query Instagram TV videos (read support was introduced in v10.0 and limited to v10.0+).

Starting with v14.0, the `video_title` field will no longer be supported and the API will throw an error if the field is requested.

## June 8, 2021

#### Like Counts

*Applies to v11.0+. Will apply to all versions September 7, 2021.*

If indirectly querying an [IG Media](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-media) through another endpoint or field expansion, the [`like_count`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-media#fields) field will be omitted from API responses if the media owner has hidden like counts on it. Directly querying the IG Media (which can only be done by the IG Media owner) will return the actual like count, however, even if like counts have been hidden.



#### Time-based Pagination

*Applies to v11.0+*.

Added [`since`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-media/#query-string-parameters) and [`until`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-media/#query-string-parameters) parameters to the [`GET /{ig-user-id}/media`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-media/#reading) endpoint to support [time-based pagination](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/using-graph-api#time).

Directly querying the IG Media, which can only be done by the IG Media owner, will return the actual like count, even if the owner has hidden like counts on the media.
