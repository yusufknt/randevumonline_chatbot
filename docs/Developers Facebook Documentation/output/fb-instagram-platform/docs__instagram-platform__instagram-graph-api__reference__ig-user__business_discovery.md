### Field Expansion

You can use field expansion get public fields on the targeted [IG User](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-user). Refer to the [IG User](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-user) reference for a list of public fields.

### Sample Request with Field Expansion

Getting data about the Instagram Business [IG User](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-user) "Blue Bottle Coffee" and using field expansion to request its followers and media counts.

```
GET graph.facebook.com
  /17841405309211844
    ?fields=business_discovery.username(bluebottle){followers_count,media_count}
```

### Sample Response

```
{
  "business_discovery": {
    "followers_count": 267788,
    "media_count": 1205,
    "id": "17841401441775531"
  },
  "id": "17841405309211844"
}
```

### Accessing Edges with Field Expansion

You can also use field expansion to access the `/media` edge on the targeted [IG User](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-user) and specify the fields and metrics that should be returned for each [IG Media](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-media) object. Refer to the [Media node reference](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-media) for a list of public fields.

### Sample Request with Edge

```
GET graph.facebook.com
  /17841405309211844
    ?fields=business_discovery.username(bluebottle){followers_count,media_count,media}
```

### Sample Response with Edge

```
{
  "business_discovery": {
    "followers_count": 267788,
    "media_count": 1205,
    "media": {
      "data": [
        {
          "id": "17858843269216389"
        },
        {
          "id": "17894036119131554"
        },
        {
          "id": "17894449363137701"
        },
        {
          "id": "17844278716241265"
        },
        {
          "id": "17911489846004508"
        }
      ],
    },
    "id": "17841401441775531"
  },
  "id": "17841405309211844"
}
```

### Pagination

The `/media` edge supports [cursor-based pagination](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/using-graph-api#paging), so when accessing it via field expansion, the response will include `before` and `after` cursors if the response contains multiple pages of data. Unlike standard cursor-based pagination, however, the response will not include `previous` or `next` fields, so you will have to use the `before` and `after` cursors to construct `previous` and `next` query strings manually in order to page through the returned data set.

### Sample Request

```
GET graph.facebook.com
  /17841405309211844
    ?fields=business_discovery.username(bluebottle){media{comments_count,like_count,view_count}}
```

### Sample Response
