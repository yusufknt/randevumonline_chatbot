# Get Conversations

This document explains how to get information about conversations between your app user and an Instagram user interested in your app user's Instagram media. You can get:

- A list of conversations for your app user's Instagram professional account
- A list of messages within each conversation
- Details about each message including when the message was sent and from who

## Requirements

This guide assumes you have read the [Instagram Platform Overview](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/overview) and implemented the needed components for using this API, such as a Meta login flow and a webhooks server to receive notifications.

You will need the following:

#### Access Level

- Advanced Access if your app serves Instagram professional accounts you don't own or manage
- Standard Access if your app serves Instagram professional accounts you own or manage and have added to your app in the App Dashboard

#### Access tokens

- An Instagram User access token requested from a person who can manage messages on the Instagram professional account

#### Base URL

All endpoints can be accessed via the `graph.instagram.com` host.

#### Endpoints

- `/<IG_ID>/conversations` or `/me/conversations`

#### IDs

- The ID for the Instagram professional account (`<IG_ID>`)
- The Instagram-scoped ID for the Instagram user in the conversation

#### Permissions

- `instagram_business_basic`
- `instagram_business_manage_messages`

### Limitations

- Only the image or video URL for a share will be included in the data returned in a call to the API or in the webhooks notification.
- Conversations that are within the Requests folder that have not been active for 30 days will not be returned in API calls.

## Get a List of Conversations

To get a list of your app user's conversations for an Instagram professional account, send a `GET` request to the `/<IG_ID>/conversations` endpoint.

#### Sample Request

*Formatted for readability*

```
curl -i -X GET "https://graph.instagram.com/v25.0/me/conversations
    ?platform=instagram
    &access_token=<INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

On success, your app will receive a JSON object with a list of IDs for the conversations between you and a person and the most recent time a message was sent.

```
{
  "data":
    {
      "id": "<CONVERSATION_ID_1",
      "updated_time": "<UNIX_TIMESTAMP>"
    },
    {
      "id": "<CONVERSATION_ID_2",
      "updated_time": "<UNIX_TIMESTAMP>"
    }
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Find a conversation with a specific person

To get a conversation between your app user's Instagram professional account and a specific Instagram user, send a `GET` request to the `/<IG_ID>/conversations` endpoint with the following parameters:

- `user_id` parameter set to the Instagram-scoped ID for the Instagram user in the conversation

#### Sample Request

*Formatted for readability*

```
curl -i -X GET "https://graph.instagram.com/v25.0/me/conversations
    ?user_id=<IGSID>
    &access_token=<INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

On success, your app will receive the ID for the conversation.

```
{
  "data": [
      {
        "id": "<CONVERSATION_ID>
      },
  ]
}
```

## Get a List of Messages in a Conversation

To get a list of messages in a conversations, send a `GET` request to the `/<CONVERSATION_ID>` endpoint with the `fields` parameter set to `messages`.

#### Sample Request

*Formatted for readability*

```
curl -i -X GET "https://graph.instagram.com/v25.0/<CONVERSATION_ID>
    &fields=messages
    &access_token=<INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

On success, your app will receive a list of message IDs and the time each message was created.

```
{
  "messages": {
    "data": [
      {
        "id": "<MESSAGE_1_ID>",
        "created_time": "<UNIX_TIMESTAMP_MOST_RECENT_MESSAGE>"
      },
      {
        "id": "<MESSAGE_2_ID>",
        "created_time": "<UNIX_TIMESTAMP>"
      },
      {
        "id": "<MESSAGE_3_ID>",
        "created_time": "<UNIX_TIMESTAMP>"
      },
...
    ]
  },
  "id": "<CONVERSATION_ID>",
}
```

### Get information about a message

To get information about a message, such as the sender, receiver, and message content, send a `GET` request to the `/<MESSAGE_ID>` endpoint with the `fields` parameter set to a comma separated list of fields you are interested in.

Default fields are `id` and `created_time`.

**Note:** Queries to the `/<CONVERSATION_ID>` endpoint will return all message IDs in a conversation. However, you can only get details about the 20 most recent messages in the conversation. If you query a message that is older than the last 20, you will see an error that the message has been deleted.

#### Sample request

*Formatted for readability*

```
curl -i -X GET "https://graph.instagram.com/v25.0/<MESSAGE_ID>
    &fields=id,created_time,from,to,message
    &access_token=<INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

On success, your app will receive a JSON response with a list of fields that you requested and values for each.

### Example reponse

```
{
  "id": "aWdGGiblWZ...",
  "created_time": "2022-07-12T19:11:07+0000",
  "to": {
    "data": [
      {
        "username": "<IG_ID_USERNAME>",
        "id": "<IG_ID>"
      }
    ]
  },
  "from": {
    "username": "<IGSID_USERNAME>",
    "id": "<IGSID>"
  },
  "message": "Hi Kitty!"
}
```
