# Instagram Creator Marketplace API

Instagram's creator marketplace is where you can discover and evaluate Instagram creators for [partnership ads](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F292748974937716&h=AUBokp932ixctLfUKCY0SjFbIxkjwj5Myl385AVTCLb2hwu-vw9EdwmQ5y105UkBiDha79ZhRfYfN7so6cz8uhIjMxd3WCGAdMU7voni6d-CcMh4BObXvQDQ27OZ2HObxaC7WZ0TZDOPBw). The API offers personalized creator recommendations and search using authenticated first-party data to help your brand find the right creators for your partnership ad campaigns. You can evaluate creators for partnership ads using authenticated, real-time first-party data.

## Before you begin

### Permissions

To use these APIs, permissions must be granted using [Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/). These permissions are required to access the creator marketplace API:

- `instagram_creator_marketplace_discovery`
- `instagram_basic`
- `pages_manage_metadata`
- `pages_show_list`
- `business_management`

Note: For the `instagram_creator_marketplace_discovery` permission, your app must have **advanced access**, which requires app review. When you first get access to `instagram_creator_marketplace_discovery` permission, you will be auto-granted standard access. Standard access will give you access to test data for testing and implementation purposes.

### Eligibility

In the brand onboarding flow, Meta will check if your brand is [eligible for Instagram’s creator marketplace](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F672550269221197%2F%3Fhelpref%3Drelated_articles&h=AUBA2TfJyo8o1J33E8QUpDedJUg8LdDms1pOPIFa9TMevQJAvpmYLQr004VseIN90B9at50nWwK3JqwEykTHqSjeuqZqIgxnXWgcNf0OZ_BjBS-U5JOelq_ExSCHIKQp3c222wFEkH4bgg). If your brand is eligible but has not onboarded to the creator marketplace, you will need to accept the [Instagram Creator Marketplace Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/488723392994445).

### Access Tokens

This API requires a [Page access token](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/guides/access-tokens/#pagetokens) for a Page that is connected to your brand’s Instagram business account and is either eligible to onboard or has onboarded to Instagram’s creator marketplace as a brand.

## Rate Limits

The creator marketplace APIs enforce rate limits at both the Instagram account level and the application level.

- Account-level limits: Requests are capped at 1000 per user per hour.
- Application-level limits: The number of calls an app can make within a rolling one-hour window is calculated as: `Calls per hour = 1000 * Number of Effective Users`. **Number of Effective Users** is determined by the app’s number of unique daily active users (DAUs). If your app experiences fluctuating usage, such as higher activity on weekends and lower activity during weekdays, the calculation may use weekly or monthly active users to better reflect typical usage patterns instead.

## App Review

### Instructions for Developers

Your app review should clearly demonstrate how your app authenticates users and accesses data from Instagram’s creator marketplace.

#### 1. Authentication Process

- **UI (user-facing) apps:**
  - Before you begin recording your demo for app review, ensure that you have included the `instagram_creator_marketplace_discovery` permission in your configuration. You can access this permission by using the existing Instagram Creator Marketplace template during setup.
  - Show the complete, end-to-end Facebook Login flow inside your app. The login flow should match the video in the [Login Flow Experience](#login-flow-experience) section below as closely as possible.
  - Show the user connecting their Instagram account via a linked Facebook Page.
  - Clearly show where the user (brand) reviews and grants consent for creator search. Your app review video should clearly show the list of permissions and ensure that "Discover content creators on the Instagram Creator Marketplace platform" is visible.
  - Example screencast: [How to produce a screencast for app review](https://developers.facebook.com/videos/2021/developing-for-success-how-to-produce-a-screencast-for-app-review/)
- **Server-to-server (S2S, no UI) apps:**
  - Explain your backend authentication setup (system users, tokens, permissions).
  - Clearly state that your app is server-to-server in your submission.
  - Confirm in the screencast that the app operates as S2S.
  - If direct testing isn’t possible, provide detailed use cases and evidence supporting the S2S workflow.

#### 2. End-to-End Permission Usage

1. Explain and demonstrate how you use the `instagram_creator_marketplace_discovery` permission to discover creators. Include the specific purpose for why the app needs this functionality.
2. In your recorded video, demonstrate how you perform a creator search on your app UI using the Instagram Creator Marketplace API.
3. Show how your app retrieves and processes creator insights, such as creator bio, follower count, and account reach.

## Discovery API
