# Instagram Media Insights

Represents social interaction metrics on your app user's Instagram Media object.

Instagram Insights are now available for Instagram API with Instagram Login. [Learn more.](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/insights)

Introducing the `views` metric for [`FEED`, `STORY`, and `REELS` media product types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/reference/instagram-media#fields).

The following metrics have been deprecated for v22.0 and will be deprecated for all versions on April 21, 2025:

- `plays`
- `clips_replays_count`
- `ig_reels_aggregated_all_plays_count`
- `impressions`

**Note:** API requests with the `impressions` metric will continue to return data for media created on or before July 1, 2024 for v21.0 and older. API requests made after April 21, 2025 for media created on or after July 2, 2024 will return an error.

The `video_views` metric has been deprecated.

## Reading

**`GET /<INSTAGRAM_MEDIA_ID>/insights`**

Get insights data on an Instagram Media object.

### Limitations

- If insights data you are requesting does not exist or is currently unavailable, the API returns an empty data set instead of `0` for individual metrics.
- Data used to calculate metrics can be delayed up to 48 hours.
- Metrics data is stored for up to 2 years.
- Metrics such as `comments`, `likes`, `views`, and `total_interactions` report organic interaction metrics only; interactions on ads containing a media object are not counted. The `total_likes`, `total_comments`, and `total_views` metrics return aggregated counts that include engagement from promoted/boosted/ad media. These total metrics are available for Instagram API with Facebook Login only. Crossposted Facebook post's count may be included if that post is accessible by the session user.

#### Album metrics

- Insights data is not available for any media within an [Instagram Media](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-media) album.

#### Story media metrics

- Story media metrics are only available for 24 hours.
  - Set up [`Instagram` webhooks](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/guides/webhooks) and subscribe to the `story_insights` field to get story insights for a story before they expire. You may receive data after the story expires if the story is added to a highlight. This may return different results for API calls, webhook notifications, and UIs.
- Story media metrics with values less than 5 return an error code `10` with the message `(#10) Not enough viewers for the media to show insights`.
- For Stories created by users in Europe and Japan, the `replies` metric now returns a value of `0`.
- Replies made by users in Europe and Japan are not included in `replies` calculations for story media metrics.

#### Webhooks

- Insights webhook for Instagram API with Instagram Login is not supported.

### Metrics

The following table shows the metrics and the media object types the are available on.

| Metric | Media Product Type |
| --- | --- |
| `clips_replays_count`  Deprecated for v22.0 and for all versions on April 21, 2025.  The number of times your reel starts to play again after an initial play of your video. This is defined as replays of 1ms or more in the same reel session. | `REELS` |
| `comments`   Number of comments on the media object. | `FEED` (posts) `REELS` |
| `crossposted_views`   Total number of times the video IG Media was played, aggregated across Instagram and Facebook. Throws if the media is not shared to Facebook | `REELS` |
| `facebook_views`   Total number of times IG Media has been played on Facebook. Throws if the media is not shared to Facebook. For REELS, this can be either plays from crossposted or cross recommended from Instagram to Facebook | `FEED` (posts) `REELS` `STORY` |

| `ig_reels_aggregated_all_plays_count`  Deprecated for v22.0 and for all versions on April 21, 2025.  The number of times your reel starts to play or replay after an impression is already counted. This is defined as plays of 1ms or more. Replays are counted after the initial play in the same reel session.  Note that this count may be greater than the sum of `clips_replays_count` and `plays`. This is because `clips_replays_count` and `plays` only count plays in the Instagram app, while `ig_reels_aggregated_all_plays_count` also includes plays in the Facebook app through Cross App Recommendation (XAR). | `REELS` |
| `ig_reels_avg_watch_time`   The average amount of time spent playing the reel. | `REELS` |
| `ig_reels_video_view_total_time`   The total amount of time the reel was played, including any time spent replaying the reel. [Metric in development.](https://business.facebook.com/business/help/metrics-labeling) | `REELS` |

| `reels_skip_rate`   The percentage of views from people who skipped during the first 3 seconds of the reel.

### Breakdowns

You can also include the `breakdown` parameter for specific metrics to divide data into smaller sets based on the specified breakdown value. Values can be:

| `breakdown` value | Response values |
| --- | --- |
| `action_type`  **Only compatible with the `profile_activity` metric.**  Break down results by the profile component within the native app that viewers tapped or clicked after viewing the app user's profile. | - `BIO_LINK_CLICKED` - `CALL` - `DIRECTION` - `EMAIL` - `OTHER` - `TEXT` |
| `story_navigation_action_type`  **Only compatible with the `navigation` metric.**  Break down results by navigation action taken by the viewer upon viewing the media within the native app. Adding all of these action types will give you the total navigation insights. | - `SWIPE_FORWARD` equals "Next Story" - `TAP_BACK` equals "Back" - `TAP_EXIT` equals "Exit" - `TAP_FORWARD` equals "Forward" |

**NOTE:** If you request a metric that doesn't support breakdowns, the API will return an error ("`An unknown error has occurred.`"), so be careful if requesting multiple metrics in a single query.

### Response syntax

On success your app receives a JSON object containing the results of your query. Results can include the following data, based on your query specifications:
