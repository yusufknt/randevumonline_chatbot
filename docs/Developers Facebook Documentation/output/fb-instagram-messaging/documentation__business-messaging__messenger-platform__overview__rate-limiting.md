# Messenger Platform rate limits

Updated: Mar 23, 2026

Rate limits for the Messenger Platform depend on the API used and, in some cases, the message content.

## Messenger API

Requests made by your app are counted against the number of calls your app can make in a rolling 24-hour period, calculated as follows:

```
Calls within 24 hours = 200 * Number of Engaged Users
```

The **Number of Engaged Users** is the number of people the business can message through Messenger.

### Conversations API

- Your app can make 2 calls per second per Facebook Page.

### Send API

- Your app can make 300 calls per second per Facebook Page for messages that contain text, links, reactions, and stickers.
- Your app can make 10 calls per second per Facebook Page for messages that contain audio or video content.
- Your app may be rate limited if too many messages are sent to a single thread.

### Private Replies API

- Your app can make 750 calls per hour per Facebook Page for private replies to comments on Instagram posts and reels.

## Messenger API for Instagram

Requests made by your app are counted against the number of calls your app can make per Instagram Professional account and the API used.

### Conversations API

- Your app can make 2 calls per second per Instagram Professional account.

### Send API

- Your app can make 300 calls per second per Instagram Professional account for messages that contain text, links, reactions, and stickers.
- Your app can make 10 calls per second per Instagram Professional account for messages that contain audio or video content.
- Your app may be rate limited if too many messages are sent to a single thread.

### Private Replies API

- Your app can make 100 calls per second per Instagram Professional account for private replies to Instagram Live comments.
- Your app can make 750 calls per hour per Instagram Professional account for private replies to comments on Instagram posts and reels.

## High-volume messaging

If your app user’s Page or Instagram Professional account sends or receives a high volume of messages, the inbox can no longer display or send new messages until the volume decreases.

### Messenger

If a Page sends more than 40 messages per second or constantly sends or receives messages in a large number of conversations at the same time, new messages are not displayed in the Page Inbox and the Page cannot send new messages until the volume decreases.

If a Page hits the high-volume limit, API calls to get all conversations fail. You can still call a single conversation to get new messages for that conversation.

### Instagram

If an Instagram Professional account sends and receives more than 72,000 messages, new messages are not displayed in the Instagram Inbox and the account cannot send new messages until the volume decreases.

Banners are displayed in the conversation indicating the limit has been reached. These banners stop showing when the message volume decreases.

- **Your Message May Be Delayed** -- Your message may take longer than usual to be delivered because [your-account-name] is receiving a large number of messages.
- **Your Message Wasn’t Delivered** -- Your message wasn’t delivered because [your-account-name] is receiving a large number of messages. Please try again later.
