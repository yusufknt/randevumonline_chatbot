# Overview for the Messenger Platform

Updated: Mar 23, 2026

Messenger from Meta lets a business’ Facebook Page or Instagram Professional account respond to people who message them through Facebook, Instagram, or a Meta plugin on your mobile app or website. A person must initiate the conversation. The Messenger Platform is free to use.

## How it works

When a person sends a message to your business Page or Instagram Professional account, a webhook notification is triggered. Your app calls the Meta social graph to retrieve the conversation, determine the appropriate reply, and send a response within 24 hours. You can send an automatic reply, have a live agent respond, or use a combination of both.

The platform supports this at scale and provides a wide variety of conversation entry points and message types.

### Scoped IDs

Each person who messages your Facebook Page or Instagram Professional account is assigned a scoped ID unique to that account. This ID allows you to map interactions for the same person across multiple messaging apps.

- **Page-scoped ID** -- Created when a person messages your Facebook Page.
- **Instagram-scoped ID** -- Created when a person messages your Instagram Professional account.

### Limitations

- A person logged in to Facebook cannot message your Instagram Professional account. Similarly, a person logged in to Instagram cannot message your Facebook Page using the Messenger Platform.
- Instagram Messaging is available for any Instagram Professional account for a business or creator.

## Key concepts

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Access tokens](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/facebook-login/guides/access-tokens) | Opaque strings that provide temporary, secure access to Meta social graph endpoints for sending and receiving messages. |
| [Page access tokens](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/facebook-login/guides/access-tokens#page-access-tokens) | A type of access token used to make API calls on behalf of a Facebook Page. Required to send and receive messages through the Messenger Platform. Generated after a Page admin grants your app the necessary permissions. |
| [Access levels](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview/access-levels) | **Standard Access**<br>(default) limits data to users with a Role on your app or Page.<br>**Advanced Access**<br>extends data access to all app users and requires<br>[App Review](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-review)<br>. |
| [Facebook Login for Business](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/facebook-login/facebook-login-for-business) | Required to request permissions from your app users to send and receive messages on their behalf. |
| [Webhooks](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/webhooks) | Real-time notifications about messages sent to your Page or Instagram Professional account, avoiding the need to poll the Meta social graph. |
| [Rate limiting](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages/rate-limiting) | Limits on API call volume and message throughput. High-volume messaging can temporarily disable inbox functionality. |
| [Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/messenger-platform/policy) | Platform policies, responsiveness requirements, and community standards you must follow to maintain API access. |
| CDN URLs | Privacy-aware Content Delivery Network URLs for retrieving rich media shared by Instagram users. The URL stops returning media after content is deleted or expired. |

## Before you begin

To implement the Messenger Platform, you need:

- A [registered Meta developer account](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development)
- A [Meta app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app) with the [Messenger use case](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app/messenger-use-case)
- A [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/461775097570076) linked to your app
- An [Instagram Professional account](https://help.instagram.com/502981923235522) (for Instagram Messaging)
- [Business Verification](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release/business-verification) (if your app is used by people without a Role on the app)
- [App Review](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-review) (if your app needs Advanced Access). Not required if you only send and receive messages for your own Facebook Page.

### Permissions

Request the following permissions through Facebook Login for Business for Messenger conversations:

- `pages_show_list`
- `pages_manage_metadata`
- `pages_messaging`
- `pages_read_engagement`
- `business_management`

For Instagram Messaging, also request:

- `instagram_basic`
- `instagram_manage_messages`

The `business_management` permission is a dependency for `pages_messaging`, `pages_show_list`, and `instagram_manage_messages`. Call this out in your [App Review](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-review) submission. The app user requesting the Page access token must be able to perform the `MESSAGING` and `MODERATE` [Page tasks](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages/overview/permissions-features#tasks).
