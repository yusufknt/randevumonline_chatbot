# Generic template

Updated: Apr 22, 2026

The generic template is a simple structured message that includes a title, subtitle, image, and up to three buttons. You may also specify a `default_action` object that sets a URL that is opened in the Messenger webview when the template is tapped.

## Carousel

The Messenger Platform supports sending a horizontally scrollable carousel of generic templates. To create a scrollable carousel, include up to 10 generic templates in the `elements` array of the `payload`.

## Best practices

- Use for messages with a consistent information hierarchy (for example, product or article previews, weather forecasts).
- Use the correct aspect ratio for your image. Photos in the generic template that are not 1.91:1 are scaled or cropped.
- Do not use if your message does not have structured information or require hierarchy.
- Do not use if you need people to be able to zoom your image to full screen.
- Do not use GIFs in the template if you intend for them to be animated. GIFs are supported but are not animated.

### Carousel best practices

- Use a carousel when there is a priority order to your content — the first item is probably the most interesting.
- Strive for consistency. If one bubble has a photo, include a photo in all of them.
- Minimize the number of generic templates in your carousel. Too many makes it hard for people to remember all the options.
- Do not mix types of content. If you include an article next to a list of products, your experience could cause confusion.
- Do not use a carousel when it is important that people see everything in the list. They may not scroll to the end.
